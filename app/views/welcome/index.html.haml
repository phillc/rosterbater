    %h2 Fantasy Football - Random in season stats
    %p
      I often need help cherry-picking interesting data from my league, so I created some sortable tables. This will eventually include charts and other visualizations.

    %h3 Example in season stats
    %table.table
      %thead
        %tr
          %th Name
          %th Number of teams
      %tbody
        - @season_leagues.each do |league|
          %tr
            %td
              = link_to league.name, league_path(league)
            %td
              = league.num_teams

    %h2 Fantasy Football - Post Draft Visualization Board
    %p
      This is a simple tool that gives a visualization of your draft after automatically importing your league's draft results. Colors represent the difference between where a player was picked vs their ranking, to help see which picks were good deals and which were reaches. You can compare draft picks against Yahoo's Average Draft Pick, or to #{link_to "Expert Consensus Rankings", "http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/consensus-cheatsheets.php"} in either PPR or standard formats.

    %h3 Example Post Draft Visualization Boards
    %table.table
      %thead
        %tr
          %th Name
          %th Number of teams
      %tbody
        - @draft_leagues.each do |league|
          %tr
            %td
              = link_to league.name, draft_board_league_path(league)
              - if league.is_auction_draft?
                (auction)
            %td
              = league.num_teams
