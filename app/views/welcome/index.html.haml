      %h2 Fantasy Football - Random in season stats
      %p
        I often need help cherry-picking interesting data from my league for weekly emails and trash talk, so I created some sortable tables. This will eventually include charts and other visualizations.

      %h3 Example in season stats
      %table.table.table-bordered.table-striped
        %thead
          %tr
            %th Name
            %th Number of teams
        %tbody
          - @season_leagues.each do |league|
            %tr
              %td
                = link_to league.name, league_path(league)
              %td
                = league.num_teams

      %h2 Fantasy Football - Post Draft Visualization Board
      %p
        This is a simple tool that gives a visualization of your draft after automatically importing your league's draft results. Colors represent the difference between where a player was picked vs their ranking, to help see which picks were good deals and which were reaches. You can compare draft picks against Yahoo's Average Draft Pick, or to #{link_to "Expert Consensus Rankings", "http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/consensus-cheatsheets.php"} in either PPR or standard formats.

      %h3 Example Post Draft Visualization Boards

        %thead
          %tr
            %th Name
            %th Number of teams
        %tbody

            %tr
              %td
                = link_to league.name, draft_board_league_path(league)
                - if league.is_auction_draft?
                  (auction)
              %td
                = league.num_teams
