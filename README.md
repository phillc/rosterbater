## Installation

- Clone this repository
- Add yahoo key, secret, and uid to the environment (this project uses dot env, so one way to achieve that is to copy .env.example to .env and fill them out there)

## Notes

- The administative side of this site can be extremely frustrating... for example to populate the games, you have to log in. When you login, there are no games, so it blows up.
- I'm fairly certain I am way behind on some gems
- There are remains of old ideas I had scattered through the code base. Things like bringing in vegas odds to create your own rankings. Doubt I'll ever get to it, but I don't doubt there exists some dead code.

## Contribution

Fork, and do your work. Any work on the server side must include specs.
